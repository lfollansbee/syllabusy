##3rd Place Winner at Startup Weekend EDU Denver project - Syllabusy

###Summary
This project is an MVP that was created for Denver Startup Weekend Education, a 54 hour start-up event/hackathon. The team consisted of one front-end developer, one back-end developer, two aspiring entrepreneurs, a teacher, and a user experience engineer. The idea was to create an app that can auto-populate suggested study times based on pre-imported class syllabi for college freshmen to their Google Calendar, working around their existing scheduled activities.  Throughout the weekend we developed a business plan, screenshots of the potential dashboard, and did validation research.

###Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, Bootstrap
